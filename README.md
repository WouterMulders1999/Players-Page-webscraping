# Players-Page-web scraping
Basic webscraping tools for the [Mario Kart 7 Players' Page](https://www.mariokart64.com/mk7/). This tool is aimed to help the writers of the [news](https://www.mariokart64.com/mk7/) by automating the retrieval of important data such as AF-cuts and the improvements of site records.

This repo containt 2 Python codes. AF_cuts.py and SiteRecords.py. AF_cuts.py retrieves the data from the [AF charts](https://www.mariokart64.com/mk7/afc.php) and creates an overview of all players that have managed to improve on their AF rating. In a similar way, SiteRecords.py checks if any [Site Records](https://www.mariokart64.com/mk7/wr.php) were beaten during the period for which the news is being written.

The codes can be run from any Python editor. Alternatively, one may open a command prompt like CMD, drag the files to the command prompt and hit enter.

Both files will ask you to input where you want to save the file. For this type location/filename.xlsx.
The Site Records file will also ask for the year and then month. For this answer the given prompts by just typing out the year (e.g. 2023) and the month (e.g. 9) in numeric form.

Each python file should create one Excel file. One contains AF cuts and the other contains site records.

Both files will ask you to input where you want to save the file. For this type location/filename.xlsx.
The Site Records file will also ask for the year and month. For this input in numbers first the year and then the month.
